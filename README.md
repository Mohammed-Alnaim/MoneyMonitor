# MoneyMonitor APP

## THE IDEA

##### I wanna create an app that I will daily use to monitor my money usage, in which I will fully customize it based on my needs.
##### I will use google sheets api to get my entire data the app so I can analyze it.. either everytime reading or saving it into firestore or a local db. I will see when I start development

##### also for new entires, I will use the google forms end point so I submit the data into google sheets to be extra safe!!
```
 example of submitting a data directly to google sheets

This will submit
Groceries, 100000, SAR

```
